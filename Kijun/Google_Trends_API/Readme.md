## API Methods
-  Over Time : returns historical, indexed data for when the keyword was searched most as shown on Google Trend's Interest Over Time section.
- Historical Hourly Interest : returns historical, indexed, hourly data for when the keyword was searched most as shown on Google Trends' Interest Over Time section.
